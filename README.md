**MLB2016** 



For this task we will use the `pinnacle.data` package from CRAN. `pinnacle.data` contains a snapshot of odds over time in a subset of Pinnacleâ€™s sports betting markets. We will be using the `MLB2016` dataset, which is part of this package. You might also like to make use of `odds.converter`, another Pinnacle package on CRAN, which allows us to easily convert between different odds types and probabilities.

**Packages**

To install the required packages and load the dataset required for this task, run the following lines of code (un-comment the install.packages lines if you need to install these packages).

`install.packages("pinnacle.data")`

`install.packages("odds.converter")`

`library(pinnacle.data)`

`library(odds.converter)`

`library(dplyr)`



There are various questions that I answered using the data set, but this is not to stop you from continuing you research through the data.
