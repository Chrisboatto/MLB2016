# What was the final win percentage of the Chicago Cubs at the end of 2016?

# I subset out any time the team "Chicago Cubs" appeared in the MLB2016 data set and named it Cubs

Cubs <- filter(MLB2016, AwayTeam == "Chicago Cubs" | HomeTeam == "Chicago Cubs")

# I then split the data set into a Home and Away data set

Cubs_Home <- filter(Cubs, HomeTeam == "Chicago Cubs")

Cubs_Away <- filter(Cubs, AwayTeam == "Chicago Cubs")

# Created a column to which when the Cubs win in their respective data sets. When Cubs win it shows "TRUE" when Cubs lose it shows "FALSE"

Cubs_Home <- mutate(Cubs_Home, Wins = FinalScoreHome > FinalScoreAway)

Cubs_Away <- mutate(Cubs_Away, Wins = FinalScoreHome < FinalScoreAway)

# Bound both data sets back together with the new columns created

Cubs_Wins <- rbind(Cubs_Home, Cubs_Away)

# Totaled up the amount of time the Wins column output is "TRUE" and divided it by the amount of games played by the Cubs that season

sum(Cubs_Wins$Wins == "TRUE") / nrow(Cubs_Wins)
